# udacity_aipy_dogbreeds
Project 1 in the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree:
"Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breed"

Work on the project was completed before creating this repo, therefore
all files are commited in already finished versions.

Each file was originally created by Udacity staff. 

The aim of the project was to make certain modifications to some of the files. 
These changes focused mainly on processing and presenting data generated by 
classification functions.

Source files contain headers with information about the author,
modification dates and general purpose of the file.
