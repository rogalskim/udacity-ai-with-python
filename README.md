# udacity-ai-with-python
Projects and exercises from the AI Programming with Python course at Udacity

### Overview
This repository serves as a container for archiving all the work completed for the [AI Programming with Python]( https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) course at Udacity. This is meant to keep things tidy and organized, with all the related code in one place. Originally, each project had its own repository, but it led to too much clutter as Github doesn’t currently offer any means of grouping one’s repos.

### Contents
__Projects__
1. [Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier](/dog-breed-classifier)
   - Writing Python modules for data preparation, building a CNN and training it. 
   - Uses transfer-learning and PyTorch.
   - Several pre-trained models can be used, such as VGG-16, ResNet or GoogLeNet.
   - Final network used for classification of dog breeds.
2. [Create Your Own Classifier](/flower-classifier) 
   - Similar to the first project, but with much less starter code provided.
   - Implemented in Jupyter and PyTorch.
   - Building a CNN for transfer-learning and flower species classification. 

__[Exercises](/exercises)__
- Various smaller notebooks and mini-projects, introducing the basics of Python and Jupyter.
- Data visualization and processing using Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas.
